Modifications\nArmchair Quarterback Inc. may revise these terms of service for its app at any time without notice. By using Armchair Quarterback you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.\n8. Governing Law\nThese terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Toronto, Canada and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that State or location.\n9. Paid Services and Payment Information\nThere are no fees for the use of many aspects of the Services. However, some services, features, and products may be available for purchase (“**Paid Services**”). In addition to these Terms, the Armchair Quarterback Premium & Virtual Goods Agreement also applies to Paid Services. By purchasing or using Paid Services, you further agree to the Premium and Virtual Goods Agreement
“**Virtual Items**” includes but not limited to virtual currency, game items, avatar items, subscriptions, etc. included in Armchair Quarterback\n9.1 Overview\nWhile there are no fees for the use of many aspects of the Services, Armchair Quarterback charges fees in connection with Paid Services. These include certain subscription memberships (“subscriptions”) and certain virtual avatars, goods, currencies, or items (collectively, “Virtual Goods”) made available through the Services under this Agreement.\n9.2 Payment Information\nYou may submit your debit card, credit card, or other payment information (your “Payment Information”) via our Services to purchase Paid Services. Armchair Quarterback accepts certain payment methods that may vary by country or Paid Services. We use third-party payment processors (for example, Apple, Google, Stripe, PayPal, etc.) to process your Payment Information (our “Payment Partners”).
If you submit your Payment Information, you agree that:
- Your Payment Information is true and correct;
- You are authorized to use your Payment Information;
- You will pay for the Paid Services (including any applicable taxes, fees, and costs) by the payment due date;
- You give us and our Payment Partners permission to charge you for the Paid Services, using your Payment Information, when payment is due for the full amount of the purchase (including any applicable taxes, fees, and costs);
- We may retain and share your Payment Information with our Payment Partners in order to process your purchase of Paid Services; and
- We may retain and use your Payment Information (including any information about you and your Payment Information provided to us by our Payment Partners) to provide you with notices and disclosures relating to renewals, recurring charges, and changes affecting your purchase.
If you purchase any Paid Services via our Payment Partners, then that purchase may be further subject to the legal terms and privacy policies of the applicable Payment Partners. For purchases via our Payment Partners, your billing relationship will be directly with the applicable Payment Partner. Any fees charged for Paid Services will be billed by the applicable Payment Partner using the payment method you have provided that Payment Partner.\n9.3 Changes to Fees\nArmchair Quarterback may change the fees or benefits associated with Paid Services from time to time with reasonable advance notice of material changes. However, no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with the Paid Services.\n9.4Third-Party Paid Services\nYou may be allowed to purchase subscriptions or other Virtual Goods from third-party sellers through the Services (“Third-Party Paid Services”). Armchair Quarterback acts as payment collection agent for each seller of Third-Party Paid Services when accepting payments from you on behalf of the seller. However, sellers of Third-Party Paid Services are responsible for describing and providing the applicable Third-Party Paid Services. Armchair Quarterback does not control the quality of Third-Party Paid Services and cannot guarantee the identity of the seller providing them or the validity of any claims they make.\n9.5 Discounts and Gifts\nArmchair Quarterback may offer discounts on Paid Services and the specific terms of each discount will be stated at the time the discount is offered. For example, if you are taking part in any trial period offer that enables you to use a subscription without charge, and that trial period converts into a paid subscription upon expiration of the trial period, then you must cancel the subscription prior to the end of the trial period in order to avoid incurring charges for the paid subscription.
Armchair Quarterback users may be able to buy and gift certain Virtual Goods to other Armchair Quarterback users through the Services. You will not be charged fees to access or utilize a gift, but you may be required to provide your Payment Information in order to redeem or use certain gifts.\n9.6 Refund Policy\nYou have immediate access to, and use of, Paid Services you buy through the Services. As a result, all purchases are final, non-refundable, and non-returnable to the furthest extent permitted by law. We do not have an obligation to refund or credit for partially used billing periods.
If you reside in the EEA, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have the right to withdraw from this Agreement within 14 calendar days without giving reasons. The withdrawal period is 14 calendar days from the date of conclusion of this Agreement. To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must [submit a request](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=125906) to Armchair Quarterback.\nPlease note, however, that your right of withdrawal is lost when you purchase Paid Services that include: (a) a license to use Virtual Goods; or (b) a subscription. These Paid Services are provided to you once the Virtual Good is credited to your Account or upon commencement of the subscription, and you request and consent to these Paid Services being provided to you in this manner immediately upon purchasing them.\n9.7 Taxes and Fees\nArmchair Quarterback will charge applicable taxes and fees when required to do so, but it is your responsibility to pay for all applicable taxes and fees associated with your use of the Services and your access to and purchase and use of Paid Services, including transaction taxes, data plan fees, internet fees, and other similar costs.\n10. Virtual Goods\n10.1 Armchair Quarterback Avatars\nArmchair Quarterback Avatars are virtual avatars that you can customize, claim, and otherwise use through the Services and are a type of Virtual Good (“Avatars”).

You will lose the Limited License Rights if you breach this Agreement.\n11.Account Suspension or Termination\nAs stated in the User Agreement you must follow and comply with the rules for our Services and the rules of the individual communities you participate in. Failure to do so may constitute a breach of this Agreement and result in a temporary or permanent ban from the Services or certain communities or the removal of your posts and comments, including those communities where you might have access to aspects of or benefits from Paid Services. In such instances, you might lose the benefits of Paid Services, and we will not compensate you for this loss.\n12.
